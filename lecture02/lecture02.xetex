\section{Unix Filesystem Overview}
\label{sec:unix_filesystem_overview}

\begin{frame}{The Unix Filesystem}
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item Unlike Windows, UNIX has a single global "root" directory (instead of a root directory for each disk or volume).
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item The root directory is just \texttt{/}
    \end{leftemize}
    \item All files and directories are case sensitive.
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item \texttt{hello.txt != hElLo.TxT}
    \end{leftemize}
    \item Directories are separated by \texttt{/} instead of \texttt{\textbackslash} in Unix.
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item UNIX: \texttt{/home/sven/lemurs}
      \item Windows: \texttt{E:\textbackslash Documents\textbackslash lemurs}
    \end{leftemize}
    \item Hidden files and folders begin with a "\texttt{.}"
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item e.g. \texttt{.git/} (a hidden directory).
    \end{leftemize}
    \item Example: my home directory.
  \end{leftemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What's Where?}
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item \texttt{/dev}: Hardware devices, like your hard drive, USB devices.
    \item \texttt{/lib}: Stores libraries, along with \texttt{/usr/lib}, \texttt{/usr/local/lib}, etc.
    \item \texttt{/mnt}: Frequently used to mount disk drives.
    \item \texttt{/usr}: Mostly user-installed programs and amenities.
    \item \texttt{/etc}: System-wide settings.
  \end{leftemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What's Where: Programs Edition}
  Programs are usually installed in one of the "binaries" directories:
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item \texttt{/bin}: System programs.
    \item \texttt{/usr/bin}: Most user programs.
    \item \texttt{/usr/local/bin}: A few other user programs.
  \end{leftemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Personal Files}
  Your personal files are in your home directory (and its subdirectories), which is \emph{usually}\tsup{*}
  located at

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
      Linux & Mac\\ \hline
      \texttt{/home/username} & \texttt{/Users/username}\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  There is also a built-in alias for it: \texttt{\textasciitilde}

  For example, the Desktop for the user \texttt{sven} is located at

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
      Linux & Mac\\ \hline
      \texttt{/home/sven/Desktop} & \texttt{/Users/sven/Desktop}\\ \hline
      \texttt{\textasciitilde/Desktop} & \texttt{\textasciitilde/Desktop}\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\section{Basic Navigational Commands}
\label{sec:basic_navigational_commands}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Where am I?}
  Most shells default to using the current path in their prompt.  If not, you can find out where you are with

  \begin{block}{\colbf{P}rint \colbf{w}orking \colbf{d}irectory}
    \texttt{pwd}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Prints the "full" path of the current directory.
      \item Handy on minimalist systems when you get lost.
      \item Can be used in scripts.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  Note that if you have a path with \emph{symbolic} links, you need to use the \texttt{-P} flag.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What's here?}
  Knowing where you are is useful, but understanding what else is there is too...

  \begin{block}{The \colbf{l}i\colbf{s}t command}
    \texttt{ls}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Lists directory contents (including subdirectories).
      \item Works like the dir command in Windows.
      \item The \texttt{-l} flag lists detailed file / directory information (we'll learn more about flags later).
      \item Use \texttt{-a} to list hidden files.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Ok lets go!}
  Moving around is as easy as

  \begin{block}{\colbf{C}hanging \colbf{d}irectories}
    \texttt{cd [directory name]}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Changes directory to \texttt{[directory name]}.
      \item If not given a destination defaults to the user's home directory.
      \item You can specify both absolute and relative paths.
      \item If you do not specify a \texttt{directory}, the \texttt{\textasciitilde} (home) \texttt{directory}
            is assumed.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item Absolute paths start at \texttt{/} (the global root).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item e.g. \texttt{cd /home/sven/Desktop}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Relative paths start at the current directory.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item e.g. \texttt{cd Desktop}, if you were already at \texttt{/home/sven}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Relative Path Shortcuts}
  Shortcuts

  \begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
    \hline
    \texttt{\textasciitilde} & current user's home directory\\ \hline
    \texttt{.} & the current directory (this is actually useful...)\\ \hline
    \texttt{..} & the parent directory of the current directory\\ \hline
    \texttt{-} & for \texttt{cd} command, return to previous working directory\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

  An example: starting in \texttt{/usr/local/src}

  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg, gobble=4]{bash}
    >>> cd    # now at /home/sven
    >>> cd -  # now at /usr/local/src
    >>> cd .. # now at /usr/local

\section{File and Folder Manipulation}
\label{sec:file_and_folder_manipulation}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Creating a new File}
  The easiest way to create an empty file is using

  \begin{block}{\colbf{touch}}
    \texttt{touch [flags] <file>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Adjusts the timestamp of the specified file.
      \item With no flags uses the current date and time.
      \item If the file does not exist, \texttt{touch} creates it.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  File extensions (\texttt{.txt}, \texttt{.c}, \texttt{.py}, etc) often \textbf{don't} matter in Unix.
  Using \texttt{touch} to create a file results in a blank plain-text file (so you don't necessarily
  have to hadd \texttt{.txt} to it).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Creating a new Directory}
  No magic here...

  \begin{block}{\colbf{M}a\colbf{k}e \colbf{dir}ectory}
    \texttt{mkdir [flags] <directory1> <directory2> <...>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Can use relative or absolute paths.
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item a.k.a. you are not restricted to making directories in the current directory only.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item Need to specify at least one directory name.
      \item Can specify multiple, separated by spaces.
      \item The \texttt{-p} flag is commonly used in scripts: do not fail if directory already exists.
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item By default, the \texttt{mkdir} command fails if you give it a directory that already exists.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{File Deletion}
  Warning: once you delete a file (from the command line) there is no easy way to recover the file.

  \begin{block}{\colbf{R}e\colbf{m}ove File}
    \texttt{rm [flags] <filename>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Removes the file \texttt{<filename>}.
      \item Remove multiple files with wildcards (more on this later).
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item Remove every file in the current directory: \texttt{rm *}
        \item Remove every \texttt{.jpg} file in the current directory: \texttt{rm *.jpg}
      \end{enumerate}
      \item Prompt before deletion: \texttt{rm -i <filename>}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Deleting Directories}
  By default, \texttt{rm} cannot remove directories. Instead we use...

  \begin{block}{\colbf{R}e\colbf{m}ove \colbf{dir}ectory}
    \texttt{rmdir [flags] <directory>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Removes an \textbf{empty} directory.
      \item Throws an error if the directory is not empty.
      \item You are encouraged to use this command: failing on non-empty can and will save you!
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  To delete a directory and all its subdirectories, we pass \texttt{rm} the flag \texttt{-r} (for recursive),
  e.g. \texttt{rm -r /home/sven/oldstuff}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Copy That!}
  \begin{block}{\colbf{C}o\colbf{p}y}
    \texttt{cp [flags] <file> <destination>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Copies from one location to another.
      \item To copy multiple files, use wildcards (such as \texttt{*}).
      \item To copy a complete directory: \texttt{cp -r <src> <dest>}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Move it!}
  Unlike the \texttt{cp} command, the move command automatically recurses for directories.\wl

  \begin{block}{\colbf{M}o\colbf{v}e}
    \texttt{mv [flags] <source> <destination>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Moves a file or directory from one place to another.
      \item Also used for renaming, just move from \texttt{<oldname>} to \texttt{<newname>}.
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item E.g. \texttt{mv badFolderName correctName}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Recap}
  \begin{center}
    {\Large
      \begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
        \hline
        \texttt{ls} & list directory contents\\ \hline
        \texttt{cd} & change directory\\ \hline
        \texttt{pwd} & print working directory\\ \hline
        \texttt{rm} & remove file\\ \hline
        \texttt{rmdir} & remove directory\\ \hline
        \texttt{cp} & copy file\\ \hline
        \texttt{mv} & move file\\ \hline

\section{Flags \& Command Clarifaction}
\label{sec:flags_&_command_clarifaction}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Flags and Options}
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item Most commands take flags and optional arguments.
    \item These come in two general forms:
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item Switches (no argument required), and
      \item Argument specifiers (for lack of a better name).
    \end{leftemize}
    \item When specifying flags for a given command, keep in mind:
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item Flags modify the behavior of the command / how it executes.
      \item Some flags take precedence over others, and some flags you specify can implicitly pass additional
            flags to the command.
    \end{leftemize}
  \end{leftemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Flags and Options: A bad Analogy}
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item If you think of a command as a computer, you could think of the flags as the different hardware
          components installed.  Let's say that in this case a hard drive is a flag.
    \item The computer shipped to you with a CPU, motherboard, hard drive, etc and installed on that hard drive
          was the original operating system (say Windows).  When you start it, the computer was executed with
          the Windows flag.
    \item Now, you remove the original hard drive and insert another hard drive that has a different OS installed
          (say Fedora).  Then you boot your computer, only this time you ended up passing the Fedora flag.
    \item Nothing about the other components of the computer changed (it's just a bunch of electricity being
          routed around), but the behavior changed because of the flag you passed.
  \end{leftemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Flags and Options: Formats}
  A flag that is
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item One letter is specified with a single dash (\texttt{-a}).
    \item More than one letter is specified with two dashes (\texttt{--all}).
    \item The reason is because of how switches can be combined (next page).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Flags and Options: Switches}
  \alert<1>{Switches take no arguments, and can be specified in a couple of different ways.  Switches are usually
    one letter, and multiple letter switches usually have a one letter alias (the \texttt{ls} command has
    \texttt{--all} aliased to \texttt{-a}).}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item One option:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{ls -a}
      \item \texttt{ls --all}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Two options:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{ls -l -Q}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Two options:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{ls -lQ}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Applied from left to right:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{rm -fi <file>} $\Rightarrow$ prompts
      \item \texttt{rm -if <file>} $\Rightarrow$ does \emph{not} prompt
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Flags and Options: Argument Specifiers}
  \alert<1>{These flags expect an input, and you will encounter two general kinds.}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item The \texttt{--argument="value"} format, where the \texttt{=} and quotes are needed if \texttt{value} is
          more than one word.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Yes: \texttt{ls --hide="Desktop" \textasciitilde/}
      \item Yes: \texttt{ls --hide=Desktop \textasciitilde/}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item one word, no quotes necessary
      \end{itemize}
      \item No: \texttt{ls --hide = "Desktop" \textasciitilde/}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item spaces by the \texttt{=} will be misinterpreted (it used \texttt{=} as the \texttt{hide} value...)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{--argument value} format, with a space after the \texttt{argument}. Quote rules same as above.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{ls --hide "Desktop" \textasciitilde/}
      \item \texttt{ls --hide Desktop \textasciitilde/}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \uncover<+->{\alert{\tiny Note: The example I gave you was using the same \texttt{--hide} in both formats, but
  not \emph{all} commands will accept both.  Advise \texttt{--argument="value"} format for higher success rates.}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Flags and Options: Conventions, Warnings}
  \uncover<+->{\alert<1>{Generally, you should always specify the flags before the arguments.  In this example, the flag
    is \texttt{-l} and \texttt{\textasciitilde/Desktop/} is the argument.}}
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item \texttt{ls -l \textasciitilde/Desktop/} and \texttt{ls \textasciitilde/Desktop/ -l} both work
    \item there exist scenarios in which flags after arguments do \textbf{not} get processed
  \end{itemize}
  \uncover<+->{\alert<4>{There is a special sequence \texttt{--} that signals the end of the options.  I will use another
  flag to demonstrate:}}
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item \texttt{ls -l -a \textasciitilde/Desktop/} $\Rightarrow$ executes as expected
    \item \texttt{ls -l -- -a \textasciitilde/Desktop/} $\Rightarrow$ only used \texttt{-l}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\tiny "\texttt{ls: cannot access -a: No such file or directory}"}
      \item \texttt{-a} was treated as an \emph{argument}, and there is no \texttt{-a} directory (for me)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Flags and Options: Conventions, Warnings (cont)}
  \alert<1>{The special sequence \texttt{--} that signals the end of the options is often most useful if you need to do something
    special.  Suppose I wanted to make the folder \texttt{-a} on my Desktop.}
  \pause
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg, gobble=4]{bash}
    >>> cd ~/Desktop # for demonstration purpose
    >>> mkdir -a     # fails: invalid option -- 'a'
    >>> mkdir -- -a  # success! (ls to confirm)
    >>> rmdir -a     # fails: invalid option -- 'a'
    >>> rmdir -- -a  # success! (ls to confirm)
  \end{minted}
  \pause
  \alert<3>{This trick can be useful in \emph{many} scenarios, and generally arises when you need to work with special characters
    of some sort.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Your new best friend}
  How do I know what the flags / options for all of these commands are?\wl

  \begin{block}{The \colbf{man}ual command}
    \texttt{man <command\_name>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Loads the manual (manpage) for the specified command.
      \item Unlike google, manpages are \textbf{system-specific}.
      \item Usually very comprehensive.  Sometimes \emph{too} comprehensive.
      \item Type \texttt{/<keyword>} to search.
      \item The \texttt{n} key jumps through the search results.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
  Search example on next page if that was confusing.  Intended for side-by-side follow-along.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Man oh man}
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg, gobble=4]{bash}
    >>> man man #  you now have the manual loaded
    >>> /useful #  type /useful, then hit enter
    ############# [first result highlighted]
    >>> n       #  followed by enter
    ############# [next result highlighted]
  \end{minted}
  \pause
  \alert<2>{Note that there are subtle differences between options on different systems.  For example, \texttt{ls -B}:}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item BSD/OSX: Force printing of non-printable characters in file names as \texttt{\textbackslash xxx},
          where \texttt{xxx} is the numeric value of the character in \emph{octal}.
    \item Fedora, Ubuntu: do not list implied entries ending with \texttt{\textasciitilde}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In these OS's, files ending with \texttt{\textasciitilde} are \emph{temporary} backup files that
            certain programs (e.g. some text-editors) generate.
