\section{Working with Files}
\label{sec:working_with_files}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Users and Groups}
  \alert<1>{Like most OS's, Unix allows multiple people to use the same machine at once.  The question: who has access
    to what?}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item Access to files depends on the users' account.
    \item All accounts are presided over by the \colbf{S}uper\colbf{u}ser, or \texttt{root} account.
    \item Each user has absolute control over any files they own, which can only be superseded by \texttt{root}.
    \item Files can also be owned by a \texttt{group}, allowing more users to have access.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{File Ownership}
  \alert<1>{You can discern who owns a file many ways, the most immediate being \texttt{ls -l}}\wl
  \pause
  \begin{block}{Permissions with \texttt{ls}}
    {\small
    \texttt{>>> ls -l Makefile}\\
    \texttt{-rw-rw-r--. 1 sven users 4.9K Jan 31 04:42 Makefile}\\
    \texttt{\hphantom{-rw-rw-r--. 1 }\colbf{sven}\hphantom{ users }\# the user}\\
    \texttt{\hphantom{-rw-rw-r--. 1 sven }\colbf{users }\# the group}\\
    }
  \end{block}
  \pause

  \alert<3>{The third column is the \emph{user}, and the fourth column is the \emph{group}.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is this RWX Nonsense?}
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item R = read, W = write, X = execute.
    \item \alert<3>{rwx}\alert<4>{rwx}\alert<5>{rwx}
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item User permissions.
      \item Group permissions.
      \item Other permissions (a.k.a. neither the owner, nor a member of the group).
    \end{leftemize}
    \item Directory permissions begin with a \texttt{d} instead of a \texttt{-}.
  \end{leftemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{An example}
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item[] What would the permissions \texttt{-rwxr-----} mean?\wl
    \begin{leftemize}
      \item It is a file.
      \item User can read and write to the file, as well as execute it.
      \item Group members are allowed to read the file, but cannot write to or execute.
      \item Other cannot do \emph{anything} with it.
    \end{leftemize}
  \end{leftemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Changing Permissions}
  \begin{block}{\colbf{Ch}ange \colbf{Mod}e}
    \texttt{chmod <mode> <file>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Changes file / directory permissions to \texttt{<mode>}.
      \item The format of \texttt{<mode>} is a combination of three fields:
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item Who is affected: a combination of \texttt{u}, \texttt{g}, \texttt{o}, or \texttt{a} (all).
        \item Use a \texttt{+} to add permissions, and a \texttt{-} to remove.
        \item Specify type of permission: any combination of \texttt{r}, \texttt{w}, \texttt{x}.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item Or you can specify mode in octal: user, then group, then other.
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item e.g. \texttt{777} means user=7, group=7, other=7 permissions.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
  The octal version can be confusing, but will save you time.  Excellent resource in \cite{chmod}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Changing Ownership}
  Changing the group
  \begin{block}{\colbf{Ch}ange \colbf{Gr}ou\colbf{p}}
    \texttt{chgrp group <file>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Changes the group ownership of \texttt{<file>} to \texttt{group}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  As the super user, you can change who owns a file:

  \begin{block}{\colbf{Ch}ange \colbf{Own}ership}
    \texttt{chown user:group <file>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Changes the ownership of \texttt{<file>}.
      \item The \texttt{group} is optional.
      \item The \texttt{-R} flag is useful for recursively modifying everything in a directory.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{File Ownership, Alternate}
  If you are like me, you often forget which column is which in \texttt{ls -l}...

  \begin{block}{\colbf{Stat}us of a file or filesystem}
    \texttt{stat [opts] <filename>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Gives you a wealth of information, generally more than you will every actually need.
      \item \texttt{Uid} is the user, \texttt{Gid} is the group.
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item BSD/OSX: use \texttt{stat -x} for standard display of this command.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item Can be useful if you want to mimic file permissions you don't know.
      \begin{enumerate}[\--]
        \item Human readable: \texttt{--format=\%A}, e.g. \texttt{-rw-rw-r--}
        \begin{enumerate}[\--]
          \item BSD/OSX: \texttt{-f \%Sp} is used instead.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Octal: \texttt{--format=\%a} (great for \texttt{chmod}), e.g. \texttt{664}
        \begin{enumerate}[\--]
          \item BSD/OSX: \texttt{-f \%A} is used instead.
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Platform Notes}
  \begin{leftemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item Convenience flag for \texttt{chown} and \texttt{chmod} on non-BSD Unix:

    \begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg, gobble=6]{bash}
      >>> chmod --reference=<src> <dest>
    \end{minted}

    \item Set the permissions of \texttt{dest} to the permissions of \texttt{src}!
    \item BSD/OSX users: \texttt{--reference} does not exist, you will have to execute two commands.

    \begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg, gobble=6]{bash}
      >>> chmod `stat -f %A <src>` <dest>
    \end{minted}

    \item The \texttt{stat} command inside of the \texttt{`backticks`} gets evaluated \emph{before} \texttt{chmod}
          does.
    \item The \texttt{stat} command performs a little differently on BSD/OSX by default.  Read the \texttt{man} page.
  \end{leftemize}

\section{Types of Files and Usages}
\label{sec:types_of_files}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Plain Files}
  \alert<1>{Plain text files are human-readable, and are usually used for things like:}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item Documentation,
    \item Application settings,
    \item Source code,
    \item Logs, and
    \item Anything you may want to read via the terminal (e.g. README.txt).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Binary Files}
  \alert<1>{Binary files are not human-readable.  They are written in the language your computer prefers.}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]
    \item Executables,
    \item Libraries,
    \item Media files,
    \item Archives (.zip, etc), and many more.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Reading Files Without Opening}
  \vspace*{-0.5ex}
  \begin{block}{Con\colbf{cat}enate}
    \texttt{cat <filename>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Prints the contents of the file to the terminal window
    \end{enumerate}
    \texttt{cat <file1> <file2>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Prints \texttt{file1} first, then \texttt{file2}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
  \vspace*{-1ex}
  \begin{block}{\colbf{more}}
    \texttt{more <filename>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Scroll through one page at a time.
      \item Program exits when end is reached.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
  \vspace*{-1ex}
  \begin{block}{\colbf{less}}
    \texttt{less <filename>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Scroll pages or lines (mouse wheel, space bar, and arrows).
      \item Program does not exit when end is reached.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Beginning and End}
  Long files can be a pain with the previous tools.

  \begin{block}{\colbf{Head} and \colbf{Tail} of Input}
    \texttt{head -[numlines] <filename>}\\
    \texttt{tail -[numlines] <filename>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Prints the first / last numlines of the file.
      \item Default is 10 lines.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Not Really a File...YET}
  You can talk to yourself in the terminal too!

  \begin{block}{\colbf{Echo}}
    \texttt{echo <text>}
    \begin{enumerate}[\--]
      \item Prints the input string to the standard output (the terminal).
      \item We will soon learn how to use \texttt{echo} to put things into files, append to files, etc.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}

  If you are not at lecture, don't worry about this slide not making any sense.\wl
