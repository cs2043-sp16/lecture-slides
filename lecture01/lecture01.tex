\begin{frame}{Redacted...}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Due to technical complications on the first day, and reduced attendance due to Snowzilla,  I choose
          not to release the original slides.
    \item All we did was talk about course logistics, which you can find at
          \href{http://cs2043-sp16.github.io/}{\texttt{\colbf{http://cs2043-sp16.github.io/}}}.
    \item My original slides were greatly tailored to the words that would have been said.  Ultimately, all of
          the information presented can be obtained from the course website.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Redacted...}
  \href{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2043/2015sp/lectures/lecture01.pdf}{\colbf{Last year's intro lecture}}
  gives an excellent introduction to UNIX, the history, and the goals of this course. Note that some of the
  logistics of this year are quite different \-- anything written on the current semester's course website
  takes precedence.  A couple of notes about the differences:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item You must use a VM in this course if you are using Windows, Cygwin is not sufficient.
    \item I strongly discourage configuring a dual-boot \emph{at this time}.  We will talk about it more later...
    \item You do not have \texttt{ssh} access yet, I am waiting for enrollment to stabilize
    \item OSX: do \colbf{not} install Macports.  It is far inferior to \emph{brew}.  We will discuss \emph{brew}
          later in the course.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Redacted...}
  You are welcome to browse the other slides posted for last year, but do keep in mind that this is a different
  course and I will be covering things at a different level as well as the order will likely be switched.
